# USFS Data Catalog Docs

## Introduction
The [University of Arizona (UA) College of Information Science](https://infosci.arizona.edu/){:target="_blank"} entered into an agreement to plan and eventually develop a data catalog for the [United States Forest Service (USFS)](https://www.fs.usda.gov/){:target="_blank"}.  The agreement spans multiple years and includes multiple objectives to be met over time.


## Purpose and Objectives
The purpose of this document is describe each project objective where each objective is based on the project's Statement of Work (SOW) and to also document how each of the objectives have been satisfied.

### Objective 1
Research, develop, and test a plan to meet Evidence Act requirements for a comprehensive Forest Service data inventory, including metadata, and accompanying searchable data catalog. This is envisioned to be a multi-step process involving researching and evaluating metadata standards relevant to Forest Service work; researching and evaluating potential data catalogs relevant to Forest Service work; evaluating selected metadata and data catalog components on at least one substantive body of Forest Service data

__Research and evaluate metadata standards__

The second step in this objective was to document and evaluate metadata standards.  Standards under consideration are ISO-19115-1, ISO-19115-3, ArcGIS Pro, DCAT, and CSDGM.  Note, the documentation of the metadata standards was completed by a USFS associate under contract.

__Researching and evaluate data catalogs__

The first step to meet this objective was developing a data catalog requirements analysis (RA).  The goal of the RA is to identify functionality and features of a catalog while recognizing that functionality and features will change over time. 

__Evaluate selected metadata and data catalog components__

The component list was identified as key components for the catalog.  This component list may change over time. 

* Glossary Capability to include connectivity to defined data elements 
* Ability to connect one glossary term to other terms (graph database) 
* Business Rules Repository Capability 
* Governance Workflow Capability (tracking data entities and elements through from proposal to approval with decision gates and review periods 
* Data Discovery Capability – robust metadata repository and search engine that all USDA and FS employees can access. 
* Ability to feed specified metadata to public facing catalogs such as Data.gov 
* Data Inventory Capability – For creating data lists according to data classification schemes 
* Data Dictionary Capability – Repository for approved data dictionary standards whether instantiated or not. 
* Ability to feed metadata to Axon/EDC at USDA in an automated way. 

A second components or capabilities list was developed.  The second list is more extensive, and the time limitations of the project will restrict what components in the second list might be delivered.  

__*Metadata Catalog Platform Evaluation*__
In spring of 2024 an evaluation of different metadata catalog platforms was developed as part of identifying catalog requirements analysis.  Like other items in this document the requirements may change, and the list of possible catalog platforms may also change. 

Inventory and catalog datasets (including metadata, glossaries, data dictionaries, etc.) related to the Wildfire Crisis Strategy.  Inventorying/cataloging other datasets is a long-term interest of the Forest Service and can be incorporated into this project as time allows. 

__*Implementation Plan*__
A draft metadata catalog implementation plan has been created for development.  The implementation plan identifies the proposed metadata standard to be used for the metadata catalog’s data and a draft of field mappings from CSDGM, FS AGOL and ISO-19115-(1,3).
